    Generate synthetic data using random coefficients and standard DGP structure.
    
    Follows standard data generating process: Y = μ(X) + τ(X) × T + ε
    where:
    - μ(X) is baseline outcome function (linear combination of all features)
    - τ(X) is treatment effect function (linear combination of selected features)
    - T is treatment indicator (random assignment with probability 0.5)
    - ε is outcome noise

    overlap : float, default=0.5
        Proportion of features that are shared between firm and user treatment effects.
