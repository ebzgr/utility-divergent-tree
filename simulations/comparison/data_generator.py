Data Generator for Comparison Simulation (Continuous Outcomes)

Generates synthetic data with:
- N users with F features (uniformly distributed 0-10)
- Random 50/50 treatment assignment
- Firm outcome (continuous) with treatment effects based on X1, X2
- User outcome (continuous) with treatment effects based on X1, X2
- Both outcomes are always observed (no NaN values)
- Specific treatment effect structure as specified
